# The Booking App

This Booking App was created as the final capstone project of the **Meta Front-End Developer Certification**.

**Preview**: Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant that blends traditional recipes with a modern twist. Our goal is to provide our customers with a unique dining experience that will take them on a culinary journey through the Mediterranean.

**Instructions Received**: To create a modern responsive Front-end for the Little Lemon app with a Bookings feature which they lack at present.
